Which quantitative subjects? The choice of quantitative subjects will depend on your chosen field/s of study, your level of ability and interest in mathematics and the subjects in which you wish to enrol later in your degree. Through the mathematics path, it is possible to satisfy the quantitative requirement of the course by taking mathematics subjects as breadth. This option is suitable for students who enjoy mathematics and have strong mathematical skills. In deciding which quantitative subjects to take, you should check the prerequisites of the level-2 and level-3 subjects you wish to take to ensure you make the most appropriate choice. Breadth Breadth studies are those subjects chosen from outside the Faculty of Business and Economics. Students may take all of their 50 - 62.5 breadth points in one or more breadth disciplines. You can select subjects of your choice, or follow a breadth track: a set of complementary breadth subjects in various disciplines. Certain breadth subjects in Law or Mathematics must be taken to gain accounting or actuarial accreditation. Students pursuing an approved engineering breadth sequence or accreditation in actuarial studies should see SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS below. Breadth subjects not available for Bachelor of Commerce students: any subjects offered by the Departments of Accounting, Economics, Finance, Management and Marketing and the Centre for Actuarial Studies cannot be taken as breadth subjects (even if expressly available as a breadth subject for students based in another degree). Special arrangements: Students commencing in 2010 - 2016 who are pursuing an approved engineering breadth sequence in the civil, electrical, mechanical or software streams will undertake 112.5 points of breadth and 187.5 commerce points. Students pursuing accreditation in actuarial studies will take 62.5 points of breadth, including one breadth subject that is neither mathematics nor statistics, depending on prior mathematics study requirements. Students enrolled in the Graduate Degree Package to the Master of Engineering, and Chancellors Scholars who intend to apply for the Master of Engineering, will be permitted to take up to four specific Level 1 breadth subjects to meet the pathway requirements. Concurrent diplomas: Certain breadth subjects may be cross-credited toward a concurrent diploma (see more information on the diplomas via the link below). These diplomas offer specialised study in a range of areas: Diploma in Computing Diploma in Languages Diploma in Mathematical Sciences Diploma in Music Commencing students interested in pursuing a diploma should seek advice from both Stop 1 and the owning faculty of the diploma.

Students will gain research experience in Earth Sciences by completing an original research project in their main field of interest. The amount of work completed in this project should be comparable to that undertaken for a published journal article, and students will be encouraged to submit their work for publication. Although the assessment weighting for the literature review may be viewed as low given the word limit, particularly when compared with the final thesis, the former is largely a ‘reading topic’, from which the student is expected to place their research project into a broader context. In contrast, and as noted above, the final thesis is expected to be a far more rigorous scientific document, showing an appropriate level of insight and scientific interpretation of results, and be of publishable quality. Assessment is based on the sequential completion of: a research presentation of the research project (3%) within the study period leading to the completion of the first 50 points; a literature review of no more than 4,000 words (5%) within the study period leading to the completion of the first 50 points; a project-related oral presentation within two months of the completion of 125 points, i.e. the conclusion of the project (7%); a concise thesis of no more than 25,000 words (85%) due at the completion of 125 points, i.e. at the end of the final research project subject part; and research project reviews at the end of each semester (hurdle) These assessment requirements are applicable to the entire 125 point Research Project. The research project subject will be taken over consecutive semesters each worth 12.5, 25, 37.5 or 50 points depending on a full-time or part-time study commitment. Students must commence the Research Project in their first semester of study and the project will continue until the 125 points are achieved. The student is entitled to a total of 4 to 8 weeks of recreational leave for the 125 point subject. For how long and at what time within the enrolment the actual period of leave is to be taken needs to be negotiated with a student’s supervisor. The Research Project will be due for submission by the end of the formal examination period if an earlier date is not specified. Research Project (125 points) Students may enrol in a combination of research project subjects and coursework subjects during their enrolment as long as once the Research Project is commenced, the consecutive enrolment requirement is met and they have completed a total of 125 points for the research project by the end of their course. *Note: in the case of part-time studies, students will first enrol in Earth Sciences Research Project Pt1, and then progress through to Pt2, Pt3, Pt4 Cnt. and Pt5 .

The research projects cover a broad range of research from molecular to population and evolutionary biology in micro-organisms, insects, plants and animals. The project will be based in the laboratory of an academic staff member in the School of BioSciences or an approved external supervisor, depending on the particular research project. The research project aims to develop a range of experimental and technical skills, a capacity to set goals and to design and plan experiments. Apart from the help and guidance from their supervisor(s) each student also has a committee, which provides additional help and expertise. This committee is responsible for assessment of the research project subject. The subject also provides students with skills and knowledge for understanding original research and enhanced written and oral communication skills. For full-time students, the project will be taken over four consecutive semesters and will begin on the Monday of the first semester (students can start either semester 1 or semester 2 for mid-year intake) and continue for up to 88 weeks until the end of the fourth semester, minus recreation leave of between 4 and 8 weeks (22 weeks per semester over the four semesters). For how long and at what time within the enrolment the actual period of leave is to be taken needs to be negotiated with the student’s supervisor. For part-time students, the project will be taken over five consecutive semesters. This will typically be from Semester 3 to Semester 7 of a 48 month MSc course. Students will first enrol in BioSciences Research Project Part 1 in their first Research semester, and then progress through to Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4. *Note: in the case of part-time studies, students will first enrol in BioSciences Research Project Part 1 and then progress through to Part 2, Part 3, Pt 4(Cont.) and Pt5 .

To obtain the degree students must complete: 200 credit points of compulsory subjects Juris Doctor (JD) students are not allowed to select a fourth subject in Semester 1, Year 1. Elective subjects can only be taken in Year 2 and 3 respectively. 100 credit points of JD (quota and enrichment) and Melbourne Law Masters (MLM) elective subjects including A maximum of 100 credit points of JD quota elective subjects A maximum of 100 credit points of JD enrichment elective subjects A maximum of 25 credit points of MLM elective subjects Melbourne Law Masters (MLM) electives: JD students can apply to take up to 25 credit points of their electives (typically two) from the list of MLM electives. Students cannot self-enrol into MLM electives. Enrolments will be confirmed after a selection process has been run. Compulsory subjects Sixteen subjects are compulsory, enabling the School to provide its students with cumulative learning, by integrating both subject matter and skills across and between semesters. These subjects are organised so as to ensure a balanced range in each semester, between which linkages can be made. In addition, subjects in both private and public law build progressively over the semesters, contributing to the effectiveness of the learning experience. In the first semester of the JD students are grouped into cohorts for compulsory subjects. This enhances the collegial experience of, and learning communities forged between, students during their time in the School and establishes bonds that will continue long after graduation. Elective subjects The remaining eight subjects are chosen by students from a wide range of optional subjects offered by the School. These vary from year to year, enabling the School to respond to changes in the law and legal thinking and giving students access to the latest developments in research by some of the leading scholars in the School. Standard course plan - 3 years In its standard form, the degree is taken full time over three years. This format enables students to take advantage of other educational, professional and social opportunities during the summer and winter breaks, including seasonal clerkships, international exchanges, internships, mooting and Law Review editorial work. Flexible course plans - 2.5, 3.5, 4-6 years The Melbourne JD can also be accelerated by students with outstanding results with approval from the Law School, by utilising the summer and winter break periods to complete additional JD subjects. The Melbourne JD can also be extended and there are several different course structures available for both full time and part time students. This flexibility enables students to take advantage of other educational, professional and social opportunities during the summer and winter breaks, including seasonal clerkships, international exchanges, internships, mooting and Law Review editorial work.

Innovation is fundamentally a process of linking a technology (broadly defined) to a receiving social context (market, social environment, organisation etc.) to create something new, and reduce it to practice.  Consequently, an innovation subject is any subject that deals with (1) the technological aspects of innovation, (2) receiving context aspects of innovation, AND (3) novelty.  Beyond that, the subject area can be very broad.  Innovation subjects might deal with design, venture creation, leadership, finance or regulatory processes in the context of innovation, among others. The Human-Centred design subject is a pre-requisite for Prototyping for Commercialisation. Candidates may receive up to 25 points of advanced credit based on subjects already completed. Candidates will propose their Human-Centred Design and Innovation subjects (12.5 credit points each), and whether or not they are seeking advanced credit, in their application.

MC-TEACHSI,"Course structure The Master of Teaching (Secondary) Internship requires the successful completion of 200 credit points of study over two years of full-time study. The course requires completion of: A two-year employment-based teaching internship in a Secondary school (for four days per week); and Fourteen compulsory subjects and one elective, which must be taken in the sequence outlined in the Subject Options section. The subjects include: Four core subjects; Six Learning Area subjects (taken in two Learning Area study sequences, or in a double sequence); Three Engaging and Assessing Learners subjects (which incorporate the employment-based teaching Internship); One Professional Learning Capstone subject; and One Foundations elective. Progression Rules 1 . LITERACY AND NUMERACY TEST FOR INITIAL TEACHER EDUCATION STUDENTS The Australian Commonwealth Government’s Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students (LANTITE) is a compulsory test for Initial Teacher Education students administered by the Australian Council for Educational Research (independently of The University of Melbourne). The Faculty of Education requires each Intern to satisfactorily complete the LANTITE by the end of the first calendar year of their enrolment in the Master of Teaching (Secondary) Internship to continue the course. Failure to satisfactorily complete the LANTITE by this progression point will result in referral to the Faculty of Education Course Academic Progress Committee and may result in exclusion from the course until the LANTITE is satisfactorily completed. An excluded Intern may be granted an early exit award of a Graduate Diploma in Pedagogy* (if they have satisfactorily completed 100 credit points of the course). Alternatively, they may be withdrawn from the course if they are not able to complete the LANTITE progression requirement within the guidelines set by the LANTITE test administering body. *Note that the Graduate Diploma in Pedagogy (Secondary) Internship is not a qualification for registration to teach in Australian schools 2. COURSE ACADEMIC PROGRESS COMMITTEE Any Intern who does not satisfactorily complete a subject, meet the course progression rules, or maintain an approved teaching contract, will be called to attend a Course Academic Progress Committee (CAPC) meeting after results have been certified for each subject. Interns in these categories will be invited to make an oral and/or written submission to the Committee as per the requirements of the CAPC process. 3. EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS Admission into and continued enrolment in the Master of Teaching (Secondary) Internship course is conditional upon an Intern maintaining an approved contractual employment agreement with a school throughout the duration of their studies*. Any resignation or termination of school employment may result in an Intern being excluded from the course. An excluded Intern may be granted an early exit award of a Graduate Diploma in Pedagogy (Secondary) Internship (if they have satisfactorily completed 100 credit points of the course). Alternatively, they may be withdrawn from the course. Where an Intern is granted a Leave of Absence from the course (by the Faculty of Education), the option to continue or cease school employment will be conditional upon relevant approvals and arrangements. This may include a change to Permission to Teach, to be arranged by the Intern with the employing school and the Victorian Institute of Teaching (or equivalent Australian state/territory-based authority for Interns with a school appointment outside Victoria). Where an Intern continues school employment whilst on Leave of Absence from the course, no activities (including employment-based hours) undertaken during the Leave of Absence will be counted towards fulfilment of course and subject requirements. *Interns’ school employment match is approved by either the relevant Australian state/territory government department of education or the Faculty of Education (FoE).

502CW,"Course structure The Master of Laws requires the successful completion of 100 credit points. The course requires satisfactory completion of: 100 credit points of subjects available in the Melbourne Law Masters (MLM) program Notes: *Most subjects in the MLM program are 12.5 credit points each. Check individual subject handbook entries for confirmation. For non-Australian students: Students who have a law degree not from a common law jurisdiction are required to complete LAW70217 - Fundamentals of the Common Law (you’ll find this under the ‘Other Subjects’ heading below). International students may take no more than two online subjects (25 credit points). Minor Thesis option The Master of Laws includes a Minor Thesis option. To undertake this option students complete 50 credit points drawn from the subjects prescribed by the Law School as part of the coursework program and a minor thesis (50 credit points of study) on a topic approved by the Law School. This option requires a dissertation of 20,000 to 35,000 words or two major articles of 10,000 to 15,000 words each, suitable for publication in a learned legal journal. The two papers must be in the same subject area so that it is possible to have one supervisor for both papers. Upon successful completion of 50 credit points of coursework subjects with a minimum of 75% in each, and having completed at least one research paper of 8,000 words or more, candidates admitted to the Master of Laws can seek approval to enrol in the minor thesis. Candidates are required to submit a thesis topic and outline and seek an appropriate supervisor before final approval can be granted. The Law School can give no assurance it can provide a supervisor, and this may mean that students will need to select another topic for the minor thesis or not enrol in the minor thesis.

872BB,"Course structure Assessment will be weighted 75% to the research thesis and 25% to the practicum component. A pass is required in both components. A candidate will have appropriately experienced supervisors and an Advisory Committee who, in consultation with the candidate, will arrange a course of supervised research designed to suit the individual requirements and interests of the candidate. A candidate may be required to supplement their research program by attendance at, or enrolment in, additional subjects if considered necessary by the supervisors. There are two components to the MVSc (Clinical): 1. Research thesis Candidates will be required to undertake research culminating in the production of a thesis of no more than 30,000 words to be submitted for examination by two external examiners. The format of the thesis, including a statement on authorship, must follow prescriptions laid down by the University and found in the Masters by Research Generic Guidelines. 2. Practicum component The practicum component of this program will be undertaken during enrolment in the MVSc (Clinical). It will involve participation in clinical rounds, tutorials, seminars, and other similar activities, according to the candidate’s area of interest. The practicum component must be clearly related to the research project and will be in an area such as small animal medicine and surgery, anaesthesia, equine medicine and surgery, diagnostic imaging, dairy medicine, and pathology. The practicum component will be assessed by a three-hour written examination at the end of the candidacy and will contribute 25% to the final assessment for the degree. Regular progress reporting requirements apply, such as a probationary period, confirmation report and seminar, and completion seminar. Candidates in the Faculty of Science Clinical Residency Training Program will be enrolled in this course on a part-time basis. They will be allocated a total of 30 weeks over a three-year period solely for pursuit of research for the degree. However, candidates will be expected to pursue components of the research, for example preparation of the literature review, collection of samples or other data, and some laboratory work, during the remaining weeks of their candidacy.

Once enrolled students who wish to change their study mode must first speak to their course coordinator, as changing modes can impact on placements, course progression, and may have visa implications for international students. Students should note the following points should they wish to request to change modes: Change from Standard to Extended mode – complete an Enrolment Assistance Form via the link below and notify your Course Coordinator and the Faculty Placements team. Change from Extended to Standard mode – must be discussed with your Course Coordinator (and is only permissible in exceptional circumstances). International students – should consult with the visa team and submit a Student Visa inquiry via the link below. Student Advice and Help (includes Enrolment Assistance and Student Visa enquiry links) Progression Rules 1. LITERACY AND NUMERACY TEST FOR INITIAL TEACHER EDUCATION STUDENTS The Australian Commonwealth Government’s Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students (LANTITE) is a compulsory test for Initial Teacher Education students administered by the Australian Council for Educational Research (independently of The University of Melbourne). The Faculty of Education requires each Teacher Candidate to satisfactorily complete the LANTITE by the end of the first calendar year of their enrolment in the Master of Teaching (Early Childhood and Primary) to continue the course. Failure to satisfactorily complete the LANTITE by this progression point will result in referral to the Faculty of Education Course Academic Progress Committee and may result in exclusion from the course until the LANTITE is satisfactorily completed. An excluded Teacher Candidate may be granted an early exit award of a Graduate Diploma in Pedagogy* (if they have satisfactorily completed 100 credit points of the course). Alternatively, they may be withdrawn from the course if they are not able to complete the LANTITE progression requirement within the guidelines set by the LANTITE test administering body. LANTITE website Information * Note that the Graduate Diploma in Pedagogy (Early Childhood and Primary) is not a qualification for registration to teach in early childhood settings and Australian schools. 2. COURSE ACADEMIC PROGRESS COMMITTEE Any Teacher Candidate who does not satisfactorily complete a subject, or meet the course progression rules, will be called to attend a Course Academic Progress Committee (CAPC) meeting after results have been certified for each subject. Teacher Candidates in these categories will be invited to make an oral and/or written submission to the Committee as per the requirements of the CAPC process.

Research Project Component The first semester of study is meant for coursework only. During the first semester, students should finalise their choice of research project supervisor and research topic. The research project should be conducted in three consecutive semesters. Typically, work on the project, including the associated thesis and presentation, starts at the beginning of the second semester of study and is conducted in 60 of the next 66 weeks. An indicative total time commitment of 800 hours for the duration of the project is expected. The assessment requirements below are applicable to the entire 50 point Research Project. A preliminary literature survey and research plan (of 2 pages) is due at the end of week eight of Research Project Part 1 (hurdle; pass/fail ). An intermediate report on the progress in the research project (of 2 pages) is due at the end of week eight of Research Project Part 2 (hurdle; pass/fail). A thesis (90% of assessment) is the main requirement due after the full 50 points of enrolment in the research project component. Theses are expected to be 40-60 pages in length, excluding references, appendices, figures and tables. The thesis will be submitted two weeks prior to the end of the teaching period in the final semester of Research project enrolment. Students will have to give 30 minute presentations (10% of assessment) on their research projects in the last week of that teaching period, on a date to be announced by the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the beginning of semester.

Other structures that are suitable for part time study, or for students who enroll with credit from earlier degrees, can be negotiated with the student’s supervisor and the School's MSc program coordinator. Research Project Component The research project starts at the beginning of the third semester of study. Typically, work on the project, including associated thesis and presentation, should be conducted in 40 of the next 44 weeks. An indicative total time commitment of 400 hours for the duration of the project is expected. Leave of absence during enrolment in a research project and outside of university holidays requires the approval of the student’s supervisor. The thesis will be submitted two weeks prior to the end of the teaching period in the final semester of research project enrolment, being the fourth semester of study. The students will have to give presentations on their research projects in the last week of that teaching period, on a date to be announced by the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the beginning of that semester. |*MAST90114, MAST90115*| Students completing this option will be required to select a further 25 points of coursework subjects from the relevant specialisation.

To be eligible to submit a thesis for examination, students must be enrolled in their course for the minimum period of 24 months full-time equivalent. PhD with Coursework in Neuroscience PhD coursework in neuroscience is offered once annually (Semester 1) and provides a sound basis from which the research project can be conducted efficiently. The coursework consists of a structured 4-week program normally taken in the first month of candidature. Through a series of built-in assessment tasks, the coursework facilitates progression to confirmation. The program aims to teach essential theoretical concepts and facilitate the understanding of specialised literature. Key areas of contemporary neuroscience research provide a focus for developing advanced research skills and integrating this new multi-disciplinary knowledge into the research project from the start of candidature. The coursework brings together the cohort of new graduate researchers coming from a variety of background disciplines across the three Melbourne Brain Centre locations, other research institutes, departments, schools and faculties. Any graduate researcher undertaking a PhD that engages the neurosciences is potentially eligible for participation in this coursework. Subject selection should be discussed with the Supervisor and with the Course Convenor (Dr Kathy Lefevere-Burd) and should also include discussion as to whether successful completion of the coursework will form part of the requirements for confirmation. The coursework is a confirmation requirement for all graduate researchers enrolled through the Florey Department of Neuroscience and Mental Health, unless exceptional circumstances apply. Students seeking exemption may apply to the Course Convenor who will seek approval from the Director, Florey Department of Neuroscience and Mental Health. Applications for exemption must be submitted before the subject selection's application deadline. To select subjects, graduate researchers should complete the Subject Selection Form available from the Course Convenor. The approval of the Supervisor, Head of Department/School and the Course Convenor is required. For PhD students of the Melbourne Schools of Engineering and Science, Faculty approval should also be sought. Contact the relevant Faculty. Places in these subjects may be limited and preference will be given to first year PhD students based at the Melbourne Brain Centre, Howard Florey Laboratories and other centres and institutes for whom the coursework is part of the confirmation requirements and those who choose to complete all four subjects. This coursework is not available to Masters or other students. Refer to |*Subject Options*| for further information about the course structure for neuroscience.

Probationary Candidature (Musicology/Ethnomusicology, Composition, Music Therapy, Music Psychology and Performance Science) Probationary candidature is for a minimum of 9 months and a maximum of 12 months (or 18 and 24 months for part-time students) except where an extension is officially approved. During the probationary period the student's suitability for sustained independent work is assessed, and the Student's Confirmation Committee must be satisfied of the student's readiness for full PhD candidacy before recommending Confirmation. The Confirmation Report Form is sent to the candidate after 9 months (full-time) probationary candidature. A Committee comprising the the student's supervisor(s), and additional members of academic staff co-opted for the confirmation, meets to interview the candidate toward the end of the probationary period. The candidate may be required to verbally defend his or her written report to the Confirmation Committee, and the Committee will assess the feasibility and resource requirements of the proposed project and offer suggestions towards its successful completion. In the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, confirmation is generally recommended when all of the following are satisfied: A precise thesis topic and a fully-developed thesis proposal has been submitted, presented to, and approved by the Confirmation Panel; The candidate has attended an interview with their Confirmation Committee and satisfied the Committee that he or she is ready for full PhD candidacy. The Committee will normally require the presentation of 10,000 words of the thesis or, in the case of Composition, the presentation of at least 30 minutes of music and at least 3,000 words of the dissertation component; The Confirmation Committee is satisfied with the student's research aptitude and progress; The candidate has attended the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music’s Postgraduate Seminar at least nine times. Some students will be transferring from a Masters degree, where they will have met some of these requirements. Consequently, the probationary program for each PhD student is arranged individually according to the research training and background of the student. Probationary Candidature (Music Performance) In the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, confirmation is generally recommended when all of the following are satisfied: A precise thesis topic and a fully-developed thesis proposal have been submitted, presented to, and approved by the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music’s Confirmation Panel; The candidate has attended an interview with their Confirmation Committee and satisfied the Committee that he or she is ready for full PhD candidacy. In the case of Music Performance, the Committee will normally require the presentation of a CD or DVD of performance equivalent to a public recital of at least 70 minutes and at least 4000 words of the dissertation component. If a public recital is to be presented in support of confirmation, candidates may present in Melba Hall during the graduate performance assessment period in mid year or December. Audio-visual technical support will be available for recording the recital if required. The candidate has attended the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music’s Postgraduate Seminar at least nine times. Some students will be transferring from a Masters degree, where they will have met some of these requirements. Consequently, the probationary program for each PhD student is arranged individually according to the research training and background of the student. Probationary Candidature (Jazz & Improvisation, Interactive Composition) In the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, confirmation is generally recommended when all of the following are satisfied: A precise thesis topic and a fully-developed thesis proposal have been submitted, presented to, and approved by the Confirmation Panel The candidate has attended an interview with their Confirmation Panel and satisfied the Panel that s/he is ready for full PhD candidacy Confirmed Candidature (Musicology/Ethnomusicology, Music Therapy, Music Psychology and Performance Science) Once confirmed, a PhD candidate undertakes supervised work that leads to a thesis (of approximately 80,000 words). The thesis may be presented after two or three years of full-time study (four to six years part-time), depending on whether the student entered with a prior Masters degree. Candidates are required to present the findings of their research at the Postgraduate Seminar prior to submission. Confirmed Candidature (Composition) For the PhD (composition), the folio will constitute 90-120 minutes of music and is weighted at 70%. The accompanying dissertation will be 20-25,000 words and weighted at 30%. In addition to the consolidation of compositional output and engagement, this degree prepares composers for the demands and responsibilities of employment in the tertiary sector. Confirmed Candidature (Music Performance) Once confirmed, a PhD candidate undertakes supervised work that leads, in the case of the PhD (Music Performance), to a thesis normally of 20-25,000 words and a folio of performances in CD, DVD or other approved format equivalent to 3 full recitals or 210 minutes. The thesis and folio may be presented for examination after two or three years of full-time study (four to six years part-time), depending on whether the student entered with a prior Masters degree. Candidates are required to present the findings of their research in a Completion Seminar at the Conservatorium’s Postgraduate Seminar prior to submission. The thesis and folio must be presented in a form that can be sent for assessment by external examiners who are usually international. The performance folio therefore must consist of CDs and/or DVDs created during the candidature for the purposes of fulfilling the requirements of the PhD. Confirmed Candidature (Jazz & Improvisation, Interactive Composition) Once confirmed, a PhD candidate undertakes supervised work that leads to a thesis normally of 40,000-50,000 words and a folio of creative work in CD, DVD or other approved format. The thesis and folio may be presented for examination after two or three years of full-time study (four to six years part-time), depending on whether the student entered with a prior Masters degree. Candidates are required to present the findings of their research in a Completion Seminar at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music prior to submission.
