As such, students completing the internship subject as part of a full study load will need to manage their time very carefully.|Please do note, 'At Risk' students are not eligible to enrol in this subject.|Students should also avoid completing a 25-point industry-based final year project concurrently with the internship subject. Students who wish to do so should first discuss their plans with the Engineering and IT Placements team (|engit-placements@unimelb.edu.au|).|Certain degrees have options of specialisations. These specialisations can use up available electives. If you are considering a specialisation please seek course advice from STOP 1 and/or your Course Coordinator before considering the Internship subject (ie. before applying for any internships). If you enrol in the internship subject, you may later find that you have used up 25 points of electives, preventing you from taking certain specialisations. For that reason it is important to course plan very carefully.",None,"BUSA90473, BUSA90485, CHEN90028, GEOM90017, ENGR90027"
