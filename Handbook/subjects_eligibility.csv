Admission into or selection of one of the following: MC-BIOMENG Master of Biomedical Engineering MC-CIVENG Master of Civil Engineering MC-ELECENG Master of Electrical Engineering MC-ENVENG Master of Environmental Engineering MC-MECHENG Master of Mechanical Engineering MC-MTRNENG Master of Mechatronics Engineering MC-SOFTENG Master of Software Engineering MC-IS Master of Information Systems MC-IT Master of Information Technology MC-IT100 Master of Information Technology MC-IT150 Master of Information Technology Admission into or selection of one of the following: Biomedical specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering Civil specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering Electrical specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering Environmental specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering Mechanical specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering Mechanical with Business specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering Mechatronics specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering Software specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering Structural specialisation (formal) in the MC-ENG Master of Engineering There is an application process for this subject: Students may apply for university-sourced internships through a competitive process, or source their own internships. Students intending on using a self-sourced internship must apply to have it approved by the ENGR90033 subject coordinator by contacting engit-placements@unimelb.edu.au . An application for a student-sourced internship must be made at least two weeks before the teaching period commencement date. Students are likely to find the internship subject to be significantly more challenging than most other subjects due to the very high workload requirements of being on an industry placement, and the need to adapt to an industry environment. As such, students completing the internship subject as part of a full study load will need to manage their time very carefully. Please do note, 'At Risk' students are not eligible to enrol in this subject. Students should also avoid completing a 25-point industry-based final year project concurrently with the internship subject. Students who wish to do so should first discuss their plans with the Engineering and IT Placements team ( engit-placements@unimelb.edu.au ). Certain degrees have options of specialisations. These specialisations can use up available electives. If you are considering a specialisation please seek course advice from STOP 1 and/or your Course Coordinator before considering the Internship subject (ie. before applying for any internships). If you enrol in the internship subject, you may later find that you have used up 25 points of electives, preventing you from taking certain specialisations. For that reason it is important to course plan very carefully.",None,CodeNameTeaching periodCredit PointsBUSA90473Business PracticumSummer Term (Off Campus)July (Off Campus)12.5BUSA90485Global Business PracticumJune (Off Campus)January (Off Campus)November (Off Campus)12.5CHEN90028Chemical Engineering InternshipSemester 1 (On Campus - Parkville)Summer Term (On Campus - Parkville)Semester 2 (Early-Start) (On Campus - Parkville)25GEOM90017Spatial Industry InternshipNot available in 202412.5ENGR90027Engineering ProjectNot available in 202425
