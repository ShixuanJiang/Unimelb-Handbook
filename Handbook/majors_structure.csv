B-COM,Actuarial Studies,"Structure 37.5 credit points Pre-major study In your first and second year you will complete the compulsory BCom subjects, and subjects that are prerequisites or recommended subjects for your major. Students who are pursuing a major in Actuarial Studies must follow the mathematics pathway for their quantitative requirement. The first-year mathematics subjects are very important components of your actuarial program. We highly recommend that you enrol in MAST10008 Accelerated Mathematics 1 if you have the prerequisites, as the two Accelerated Mathematics subjects give a better preparation for second and third year Actuarial Studies. Decisions about entry into these and other mathematics subjects are made by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, not by the Centre for Actuarial Studies. If you are not able to enter MAST10008, it is recommended that you enrol in MAST10006 Calculus 2 in Semester 1, and then MAST10007 Linear Algebra in Semester 2. ACTL10001 is not compulsory and is not a prerequisite to any subsequent subject. However, completing this subject will give you a clearer view of actuarial work. Breadth study in the Actuarial major The Level 2 Mathematics subjects that you complete as part of your quantitative requirement (and their Level 1 prerequisites) are counted as breadth. Students completing a major in Actuarial Studies must also compete 12.5 points of non-mathematics breadth.

If you complete additional Level 3 subjects, you will potentially be eligible for further exemptions from the professional exams of the Actuaries Institute. Both ACCT10002 Introductory Financial Accounting and ECON20001 Intermediate Macroeconomics are also required in order to obtain exemptions. ACCT10002, ECON20001 Subject lists From 2020, new Level 2 and Level 3 Actuarial subjects are being taught to align with the changes to the professional syllabus.
