Course Code,"Majors, Minors & Specialisations"
B-ENVS,"Majors, minors & specialisations Architecture is the art and science of designing buildings and other physical structures. Architects integrate knowledge from the diverse fields and are skilled in understanding how concepts of place and space contribute to quality environments. Construction explores the management of people, processes and materials on specific building projects as well as construction methods and techniques used across the building industry. Engineering Systems involves the planning, design and construction of the built environment for the provision of essential services and infrastructure in a manner that respects and works with the natural and social environmental contexts in which it occurs. Environmental Geographies focuses on humanity’s changing relationship with the natural environment. Environmental Science gives students the skills to identify and understand the causes of environmental problems triggered by human activity. Landscape Architecture is the design profession which explores cultural, ecological and social issues in urban, rural and natural environments. Landscape Management explores rural and urban ecosystems and the human activities that shape these systems. Property is concerned with the worth and management of assets, and the people, processes and finance related to specific buildings and the property industry. Spatial Systems is the study of the science and technologies of 3D measurement, mapping and visualisation. Urban Design and Planning is founded upon the social, environmental, political, aesthetic and economic importance of design and planning in the public realm, serving the public interest. From 2016 double majors are available for certain majors within the Bachelor of Environments. Further information about double majors can be found at: http://edsc.unimelb.edu.au/double-majors Major and Minor : The introduction of minors is intended as a guide for students interested in a sequence of study in an area other than their major. A minor is a sequence of subjects that offer a secondary area of study in a specific field. These minor sequences are usually undertaken as electives, with breadth spaces used as required. Minors are not reflected in student’s study plans, and will not appear on student transcripts. Minors may in some instances offer limited credit into a 300 point program. Further information about Minors in the Bachelor of Environments can be found at: http://edsc.unimelb.edu.au/minors. Majors These majors are offered from 2015. PRE-2015 STUDENTS :If you commenced your degree pre 2015, you may not find your major on the list below. Students who commenced the Bachelor of Environments prior to 2015 should refer to the handbook entry for the year they commenced in conjunction with the 2015 handbook listings for Environments elective and Breadth subject listings.

Students interested in spatial engineering systems can explore the Digital Infrastructure Engineering Systems major. Geology major Please note that this major is no longer being offered to students from 2024 onwards. Students who commenced this major prior to 2024 and are planning to complete the Geology major may continue to do so. Students interested in geology are encouraged to explore the Geoscience major. Special Arrangements In the case of the study area of History and Philosophy of Science (HPS), students who seek to undertake further subjects in order to complete the equivalent of a major in HPS will be permitted to take up to 25 points of additional breadth study in HPS, replacing 25 points of the science requirements of the BSc. For a BSc student, the equivalent of a major in HPS is the completion of 100 points of HPS subjects (25 points at Level 1, 37.5 points at Level 2 and 37.5 points at Level 3 including HPSC30035 The Dynamics of Scientific Change. These students will be required to satisfy all other completion requirements of the BSc. This arrangement is only available to students who have not completed any other breadth subjects for credit in the BSc. In order to complete the 112.5 points required at Level 3 within this arrangement (i.e. across science and HPS studies), students should consider undertaking a Level 3 HPS subject in the second year of their course. Students who entered the BSc prior to 2015 should refer the handbook entry of the year they commenced. Prev: Course structure Next: Further study Last updated: 9 October 2024"

B-DES,"Majors, minors & specialisations Major requirement A major consists of 50 points of study at third year level within a single discipline. A discipline is an area of knowledge, such as Architecture or Spatial Systems. Please note that access to third year subjects in majors is often controlled through prerequisite chains, with prerequisite sequences for majors often beginning in first year – please refer to each major’s Handbook entry for more details. Students must complete at least one major. A maximum of two majors may be recognised. Double majors are only available in selected disciplines. Further information about double majors can be found at this link: Link Specialisation requirements A specialisation consists of 25 points of study at third year level. First and second year-level prerequisite subjects may be required – please refer to each specialisation’s Handbook entry for more details. Specialisations are a short sequence of subjects that focus particular themes relevant across multiple disciplines. Subjects in specialisations do not form part of any existing major but are distinctive and are complementary to a student’s major. Completions of specialisations may support a research pathway, lead to accreditation with industry bodies or may increase employment opportunities.
